FILE.H
     Contains methods relating to file io in kernel-space: open, close, read
write.  See prototypes for a list of *working* methods.

keysym.h
----------------------------------------
     Contains methods for translating key symbols into ASCII-encoded
characters.  There are a variety of functions, each specific to a particular
key symbol type, and a wrapper function that selects the appropriate
translation function.  The individual translation functions shouldn't be called
directly.  I make no guarantee that they'll work without the wrapper, so just
call the wrapper.  See comments for details on how to call the wrapper.
