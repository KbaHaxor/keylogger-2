FILE.H
     Contains methods relating to file io in kernel-space: open, close, read
write.  Unfortunately, reading seems to be broken (always returns a bad file
error (-9, -EBADF).  For the purposes of keylogging, this is of trivial
importance, but it might be a big deal for other stuff.  See prototypes for a
list of *working* methods.

keysym.h
----------------------------------------
     Contains methods for translating key symbols into ASCII-encoded
characters.  Thus far this header file is a work in progress, so be careful.
