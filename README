KEYLOGGER.C
     Right now, keylogger.c hijacks the sys_read function and intercepts any
attempts to read from stdin.  The thought process here is that stdin typically
"points" to the keyboard.  File io is done using the kfile header file (can I
call it a library?).  SERIOUS work needs to be done about filtering what read
attempts we intercept.
