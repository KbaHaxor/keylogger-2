ASMHACK MODULE
     This module implements a neat little function hijacking technique capable
of hijacking pretty much any function except for inline functions.  (Daniela
tells me that this is because inline function calls behave more like macro
expansion than actual function calls.)
     This is just a proof of concept, so asmhack hijacks the getpid function.
Upon installation, asmhack rewrites the first couple (specifically, seven)
bytes of getpid with some raw machine code.  The machine code essentially
encodes a jump to the hacked_getpid function specified in the module.  The
hacked_getpid function simply calls the original getpid function.  (Some fancy
footwork with regard to the aforementioned bytes is required to avoid an
twisted, infinitely recursive loop.)
     Upon uninstallation, asmhack replaces the overwritten bytes at getpid.
