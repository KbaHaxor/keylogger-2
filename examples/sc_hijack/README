IMPORTANT: This doesn't do any keylogging right now. It just hijacks the
getpid system call. It's a proof of concept.

To install:
navigate to the folder and type "make" in the terminal. You should
get a keylogger.ko file if successful. To install the module, type
"sudo insmod keylogger.ko" (if you're using Ubuntu. Otherwise, log into
the root account and run insmod keylogger.ko).

To remove module:
type "sudo rmmod keylogger" for Ubuntu. For other linux distributions, you
must be logged into the root account.
